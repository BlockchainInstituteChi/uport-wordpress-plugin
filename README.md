# uPort Wordpress Plugin

The uPort Wordpress Plugin helps developers easily utilize uPort's Decentralized Identity Platform using Wordpress, the world's most popular Open Source Content Management.

### Features

With the Uport-Wordpress plugin installed, your visitors will be able to log in with a Uport decentralized identity without the need for passwords.

If necessary, a custom landing page can be configured to for Uport users.
